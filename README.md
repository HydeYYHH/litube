litube
============

* litube is a lightweight Android WebView wrapper for YouTube, offering many additional features such as ads blocking, background play, video download and playback progress memory.

## features

- ~~**Lightweight, the installation package is only a few MBs in size.**~~(Due to YouTube restrictions, the original download method has been deprecated. To restore this feature, I integrated `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`, which unfortunately compromises the lightweight feature of the app.
   If you don't need the download functionality, feel free to use a previous release.)

* **Ad blocking, including sponsor ads and video ads.**
* **Video download, supports downloading videos, audio-only, and saving thumbnails.**
* **Background play.**
* **Display video dislike count.**
* **Playback progress memory, video quality memory, etc.**

litube
============

litube is a lightweight Android WebView wrapper for YouTube, offering many additional features such as ads blocking, background playing and video downloading.

## Features
* **Block ads, including sponsor ads and video ads.**
* **Download video, supports downloading videos, audio-only, and saving thumbnails.**
* **Background playing.**
* **Display dislike count.**
* **Hide shorts.**
* **Chat in live streams, etc.**

## Tips
* *Ignore battery optimization and allow background activity for this app to prevent it from being mistakenly killed by the system.*
* *If you don't need to download videos, feel free to use the lite version.*
* *Ads-blocking and some extensions may affect the normal behavior of Youtube and cause page to get stuck.*
* *Ads-blocking and downloader may not work on all videos â€” some ads may still be shown or some videos may be unavailable.*
* *This app should not be regarded as an alternative to other YouTube clients.*
